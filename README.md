# About
This is a compilation of several Kattis coding competition questions I have implemented. Each package contains a problem and its solution - a few of them have test cases attached.<br>
Usually each solution works by reading in console input. In BranchManager, I enabled file reading so that it would be easier for me to test and debug larger inputs.<br>
Special thanks to Professor Ian Riley of The University of Tulsa for assisting me during these implementations!
